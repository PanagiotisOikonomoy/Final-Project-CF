Java Full Stack Application using Spring Boot and React Javascript.

I used Mysql for the Database.

url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employeesDB

username:Admin

password:Admin

You will need Intellij to run the program.
Run the MyFinalApplication.

Also you will need th Visual Studio.
In the project directory, you can run:
`npm start`

http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

I used Postman to test the Application.
